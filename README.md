Welcome to my 3D printing project repository! This is a curated space to showcase my 3D printing journey, from default prints to custom designs. Whether you're a beginner or experienced in 3D printing, you'll find something valuable here.

So I got myself a 3D Printer finally, this is me trying to track what I am printing, and if that benefits others - enjoy.
