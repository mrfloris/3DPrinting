# Filaments

On this page I wish to keep track of the filaments that I have used, am using and got my eye on. Maybe this is just fun to do, but at least I will be able to find again what I've bought, where, and how many times. We will see.

Maybe I will also include some pictures about how I store them, use them, etc.

## **Filament Inventory**

Explore the filaments I've used, currently use, and plan to experiment with in future projects.

**Notes:**  
I don't mind the matte look of PLA, I don't need the shiny finish. So this gave me great results that look slick.

### **How I Store and Organize My Filaments**

Proper filament storage is essential for maintaining material quality and preventing moisture damage. Here's how I organize my filaments:

#### **1. Storage Containers**
- **Airtight Bins:** I might want to use large, airtight storage bins with silica gel packets to keep humidity low.  
- **Dry Boxes:** Some filaments, might get stored in filament dry boxes equipped with desiccant and humidity monitors.  
- Note: i really either use it unpacked on a spool right now, or they're in the packaging they got delivered in. I am still learning everything, so not unpacking anything.

#### **2. Filament Racks**
- **Wall-Mounted Racks:** I want to install a floor or wall-mounted spool holders for easy access to frequently used filaments. 
- **Shelf Storage:** And I want to install something to store additional spools, which should be organized by type and color on sturdy shelves near my printer setup.  

#### **3. Labeling System**
- Each spool is labeled with:
  - Manufacturer and filament type.
  - Date of purchase and first use.
  - Print settings for quick reference.
  - And updating this GitHub to keep track of a history of 3D Printing, because HOBBY

#### **4. Humidity Control**
- **Silica Gel Packets:** Added to all storage bins and boxes.  
- **Humidity Monitors:** Placed inside bins to ensure levels stay below 20%. (do i buy these, or..)

#### **5. Organization Categories**
- **Active Spools:** Easily accessible and mounted near the printer.  
- **Backup Stock:** Stored in airtight bins to stay pristine until needed.  (i need to figure this out)
- **Specialty Filaments:** Kept in dedicated containers with strict humidity controls. (and this too)

#### **Tips:**
- Rotate filament stock regularly to ensure older spools are used first.  
- Inspect spools periodically for any signs of moisture or degradation.

# TODO
